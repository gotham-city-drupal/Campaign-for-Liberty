Webform MySQL Views 6.x-1.2, 2011-01-14
* Fix for [#1026208] - grid component values are now formatted as a
  comma-separated list of key=val expressions.
* Fixed [#1026522] - When building the view query, field names are enclosed
  with backticks to avoid collisions with MySQL reserved words.
* [#1024200] Applied excellent patch from Frega, which adds automatic
  integration with the Data and Views modulse and thereby makes Webform MySQL
  views available
  to the Drupal Views module.
* Fix for [#1027092]: View name deduping logic uses active database name.
  Also includes a fix for $db_prefix handling in general.
* Fix for [#1024192] - $db_prefix is now properly prepended to the view name
  before storing it in the webform_mysql_views_views system variable.
