Features
--------
The module adds Slideshare (http://www.slideshare.net) support to Embedded Video Field 
module (http://drupal.org/project/emfield) exposing a third party provider to emvideo module. 
The module provides both a thumbnail and a flash embed representation of the presentations 
hooking to the Views system.

Future development
------------------
The module is more generically called "Slideshare Integration" since, in future, will also host 
an extension of the FileField CCK module (http://drupal.org/project/filefield) functionalities allowing 
to upload a presentation to SlideShare directly from Drupal, in a complete transparent way for the final user. 
The FileField integration is currently under development and will not be part of the first release of the module.
