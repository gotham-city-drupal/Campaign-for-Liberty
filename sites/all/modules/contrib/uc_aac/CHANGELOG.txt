Ajax Attribute Calculations 6.x-2.x, 2009-11-04
-----------------------------------------------
#562100 by longwave, Antoine Solutions: Initial commit of the 6.x-2.x code.
  * Original code provide by longwave
  * Code ported to Drupal 6 by AntoineSolutions

#470002 by longwave, AntoineSolutions: Let other modules interact with uc_aac.
  * uc_aac now rebuilds the entire product view form on every change. This
    allows users to leverage existing Drupal hooks such as hook_nodeapi and
    hook_form_alter to alter the appearance of the product view form.
  * The existing ubercart hook, hook_add_to_cart_data, is now called to load
    item data modifications made by other modules.
  * A new hook has been added, hook_cart_item, to allow other modules to modify
    the cart item.
