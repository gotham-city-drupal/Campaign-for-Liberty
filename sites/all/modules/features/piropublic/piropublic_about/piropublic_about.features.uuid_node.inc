Hayek that central banking distorts economic decisionmaking and misleads entrepreneurs into making unsound investments.&nbsp; Hayek won the Nobel Prize for showing how central banks&#39; interference with interest rates sets the stage for economic downturns.&nbsp; And the central bank&#39;s ability to create money out of thin air transfers wealth from the most vulnerable to those with political pull, since it is the latter who receive the new money before the price increases it brings in its wake have yet occurred.&nbsp; For economic and moral reasons, therefore, we join the great twentieth-century economists in opposing the Federal Reserve System, which has reduced the value of the dollar by 95 percent since it began in 1913.<br /><br />We oppose the dehumanizing assumption that all issues that divide us must be settled at the federal level and forced on every American community, whether by activist judges, a power-hungry executive, or a meddling Congress.&nbsp; We believe in the humane alternative of local self-government, as called for in our Constitution.<br /><br />We oppose the transfer of American sovereignty to supranational organizations in which the American people possess no elected representatives.&nbsp; Such compromises of our country&#39;s independence run counter to the principles of the American Revolution, which was fought on behalf of self-government and local control.&nbsp; Most of these organizations have a terrible track record even on their own terms: how much poverty have the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund actually alleviated, for example?&nbsp; The peoples of the world can interact with each other just fine in the absence of bureaucratic intermediaries that undermine their sovereignty.<br /><br />We believe that freedom is an indivisible whole, and that it includes not only economic liberty but civil liberties and privacy rights as well, all of which are historic rights that our civilization has cherished from time immemorial.<br /><br />Our stances on other issues can be deduced from these general principles.<br /><br />Our country is ailing.&nbsp; That is the bad news.&nbsp; The good news is that the remedy is so simple and attractive: a return to the principles our Founders taught us.&nbsp; Respect for the Constitution, the rule of law, individual liberty, sound money, and a noninterventionist foreign policy constitute the foundation of the Campaign for Liberty.</p><p><a class="blue-btn-1" href="/user/register">Will you join us?</a></p>',
